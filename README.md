### What can Carolyn do?

Carolyn is an SMS app for android which is smart enough to understand if a message is important enough to bother you with a notification or if it should show up in the main screen of your app.

More than 50% of messages that we get in India are spam, with Carolyn we do **on-device classification** to classify each message as SPAM, OTP, TRANSACTION and UPDATE so that the user can focus on what's important.
